          <h3>Welcome to We Collect Your IT</h3>
          <p>We offer a free collection service across the UK for the removal of your old IT systems. We safely reuse this equipment by ensuring any sensitive or personal information that was on these machines is either physically removed or destroyed before we reuse them.

            <h3>Why waste? We will collect...</h3>
            <p> The environmental and social benefits of reuse do not only help conserve the natural resources, but help reduce air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal. Reuse reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. It simply makes good sense to let us collect and reuse your equipment.</p>
